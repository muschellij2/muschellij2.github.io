The MOOC-generator team maintains packages to work with Google APIs from `R`:

  * [didactr](https://github.com/muschellij2/didactr) provides auth and the ability to unify streams of Google APIs for use in creating courses.
  
All of these packages are governed by common policies recorded here. These packages use internal resources owned by the "MOOC-generator" project on Google Cloud Platform. That is the name you will see in a consent screen.

Your use of Google APIs with these packages is subject to each API's respective
terms of service. See <https://developers.google.com/terms/>.
